# Bagging Ensemble Learning with Decision Trees

Welcome to the Bagging Ensemble Learning with Decision Trees repository! This project implements a bagging ensemble learning algorithm using decision trees. Bagging, short for Bootstrap Aggregating, is a powerful technique that combines multiple models to create a robust and accurate ensemble classifier. In this implementation, we utilize decision trees as the base model to form the ensemble.

## Motivation

Ensemble learning methods have gained popularity in machine learning due to their ability to improve prediction accuracy and handle complex datasets. Bagging, in particular, is a widely-used ensemble technique that leverages bootstrap sampling and aggregation to create a diverse set of classifiers. The motivation behind this project is to provide an easy-to-use implementation of the bagging algorithm with decision trees, allowing users to harness the benefits of ensemble learning for their classification tasks.

## Features

- **Bagging with Decision Trees**: The repository provides an implementation of bagging, where decision trees are used as the base model. Decision trees are effective in capturing non-linear relationships and feature interactions, making them suitable for a wide range of classification problems.

- **Bootstrap Sampling**: The bagging algorithm incorporates bootstrap sampling, which randomly selects subsets of the training data with replacement. This sampling technique introduces diversity among the base models, reducing the risk of overfitting and improving the ensemble's generalization capabilities.

- **Ensemble Aggregation**: The predictions of individual decision trees are aggregated using majority voting for classification tasks. The ensemble's final prediction is determined by the class that receives the most votes from the base models.

## Usage

To utilize the bagging ensemble learning algorithm with decision trees, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/durgesh16/bagging-ensemble-decision-trees.git
```

2. Install the required dependencies:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Prepare your dataset:
   - Ensure that your dataset is properly preprocessed and divided into training and testing sets.
   - The dataset should be in a compatible format, such as CSV or text files, with appropriate headers and labels.

4. Train and evaluate the ensemble:
   - Run the training script, specifying the path to your training dataset.
   ```
   python train.py --dataset <path_to_training_dataset>
   ```

5. Test the ensemble:
   - After training, evaluate the ensemble's performance on a separate test dataset.
   ```
   python test.py --dataset <path_to_test_dataset>
   ```

Feel free to explore the code and modify it according to your requirements.

## Dataset

This implementation can be applied to various classification datasets. The repository does not include a specific dataset, allowing you to use your own dataset. Ensure that your dataset is appropriately formatted and split into training and test sets.

**Disclaimer:**
While the bagging ensemble learning algorithm with decision trees provided in this repository is designed to improve classification accuracy, its effectiveness may vary depending on the dataset and problem at hand. It is recommended to experiment and fine-tune the algorithm for your specific requirements and evaluate its performance carefully.

Let's harness the power of ensemble learning with decision trees through bagging!
